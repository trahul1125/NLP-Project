    "UN Humanitarian Chief Mark Lowcock today released US$15 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to help fund global efforts to contain the COVID-19 virus.\t\n",
    "The announcement came as the World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded the global risk of the coronavirus outbreak to \"very high\" ƒ?? its top level of risk assessment.\t\n",
    "The WHO has said there is still a chance of containing the virus if its chain of transmission is broken. The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning.\t\n",
    "There are now cases linked to Iran in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, along with cases linked to Italy in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.\t\n",
    "Extensive testing in clinical trials has confirmed that the malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, reduces malaria significantly, including life-threatening severe malaria.\t\n",
    "Modeling studies suggests that, if introduced widely, the vaccine could save tens of thousands of lives per year.\t\n",
    "The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) is now underway to (i) support the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01 by routine health systems, and (ii) evaluate the routine use of the vaccine.\t\n",
    "In recent days, it has become clear that the distinction between these 2 sets of activities is not always recognized, and this has caused some confusion. \t\n",
    "WHO calls on industry and governments to increase manufacturing by 40 per cent to meet rising global demand .\t\n",
    "The World Health Organization has warned that severe and mounting disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) ƒ?? caused by rising demand, panic buying, hoarding and misuse ƒ?? is putting lives at risk from the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases. \t\n",
    "Healthcare workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others.\t\n",
    "But shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for COVID-19 patients, due to limited access to supplies such as gloves, medical masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns, and aprons.\t\n",
    "India recently carried out a high-level independent mission to assess and evaluate its national visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) strategy.\t\n",
    "The aim of the independent assessment mission is to identify existing gaps and measure the countryƒ??s performance in implementing programmes to achieve the elimination of the disease as a public health problem.\t\n",
    "ƒ??Challenges need to be identified as we resolutely move towards eliminating kala-azar,ƒ?� said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India. \t\n",
    ". We are confident that this independent assessment by experts will guide the national programme to address remaining bottlenecks.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "The first agreement2 to eliminate kala-azar was initiated in 2005 when India, Bangladesh and Nepal, signed the trilateral Memorandum of Understanding. \t\n",
    "The number of annual reported cases has since decreased from 32, 803 to 3128 in 2019, representing a 90% drop.\t\n",
    "We need to continue this work until the end of the outbreak, to keep the capacity in place to rapidly respond to flare-ups, to keep supporting survivors after the outbreak, and to transition the capacities built in this response toward building a stronger health system.  \t\n",
    "But to be very frank, right now the world risks dropping the baton at the finish line. WHO faces an immediate US $20 million funding gap. \t\n",
    "If no new resources are received, we will run out of money before the end of the outbreak. We appreciate the generosity of donors who have supported the response since August 2018.\t\n",
    " WHO is calling on the international community to help us end this outbreak, and keep our promises to communities to build a stronger health system.\t\n",
    "As of todayƒ??s reports, the global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 100 000. \t\n",
    "As we mark this sombre moment, the World Health Organization (WHO) reminds all countries and communities that the spread of this virus can be significantly slowed or even reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities.\t\n",
    "China and other countries are demonstrating that spread of the virus can be slowed an impact reduced through the use of universally applicable actions, such as working across society to identify people who are sick, bringing them to care, following up on contacts, preparing hospitals and clinics to manage a surge in patients, and training health workers.\t\n",
    "WHO calls on all countries to continue efforts that have been effective in limiting the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus.\t\n",
    "The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the worldƒ??s most progressive blueprint for advancing gender equality worldwide.\t\n",
    "Twenty-five years after it was affirmed by 189 countries, what progress has been made in raising this blueprint off the page? \t\n",
    "International Womenƒ??s Day the World Health Organization, United Nations University - International Institute for Global Health and the British Medical Journal have launched a special series marking ƒ??Beijing+25ƒ??. \t\n",

    "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working together to combat novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\t\n",
    "In support of this effort, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has provided US$10 million to the World Health Organization for the implementation of urgent measures to minimize the spread of the disease and to support countries with vulnerable health infrastructures.  \t\n",
    "Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on behalf of WHO greatly appreciates this generous humanitarian gesture from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which will contribute significantly to efforts to safeguard global health. \t\n",
    "This Medical Product Alert relates to a series of confirmed falsified antimalarials circulating in West and Central Africa.\t\n",
    "Medicines subject of this alert display a similar logo to the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo.\t\n",
    "Since 2013, different falsified medicines, all displaying the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo, have been reported to the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System by various stakeholders. \t\n",
    "The continued and widespread availability of these falsified medicines highlights a strong need for additional vigilance.\t\n",
    "WHO previously published two alerts on this issue (No.132 in Oct 2014, and No.131 in March 2014) This WHO medical product alert N?ø1/2020 refers to falsified Quinine Sulphate 300mg presented in six different combinations of batch numbers, expiry and manufacturing dates (see Table 1).\t\n",
    "The fraudulent use of the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo may create a false sense of product quality.\t\n",
    "Twenty-five years ago, two global events ƒ?? the International Conference on Population and Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing ƒ?? formally recognized that womenƒ??s health and reproductive choices cannot be separated from the social context of their lives.\t\n",
    "Now, researchers have created a dataset which brings together national surveys from 74 countries, representing 3 million women.\t\n",
    "For the first time, it allows them to describe trends in demand/use of modern contraceptives alongside social and economic indicators. \t\n",
    "The data is published in The Lancet Global Health and is authored by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the World Health Organization.\t\n",
    "It shows that, over time, women are more likely to have their demand for modern contraception met in countries where gender equality and their educational opportunities improve.\t\n",
    "It is almost five years now since the Nutrition Decade was declared. It is time to reflect back on its achievements so far. FAO and WHO are convening an open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders for the mid-term review of the Nutrition Decade.\t\n",
    "This review follows the ECOSOC Resolution 1989/84 regarding international decades, which provides that an appropriate inter-governmental body should appraise the implementation of a decadeƒ??s programme of work at the mid-point and at the end of the decade. \t\n",
    "The objectives of the Mid-term Review of the Nutrition Decade are to assess and evaluate the achievements in individual policy areas of the ICN2 Framework for Action, as reflected in the actions areas of the Work Programme of the Decade, over the time period from 2016 to 2020.\t\n",
    "The Mid-term Review aims to identify focus areas for priority action and promising opportunities in each of the six action areas for future progress from 2021 to 2025\t\n",
    "This assessment will guide the revision of the ƒ??living partƒ?? of the Work Programme of the Nutrition Decade as appropriate.\t\n",
    "A Special Collection on Advances in Clinical Trial Design for Development of New Treatments for Tuberculosis has been released by PLOS Medicine.\t\n",
    "This Special Collection, that is now complete with the publication of its last paper, contains a series of articles that articulate the essential new steps in clinical research that will pave the way for the development of future optimal treatment for all forms of tuberculosis.\t\n",
    "The Collection has been sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD-France), and coordinated by Dr Christian Lienhardt, Research Director at IRD-France and Dr Payam Nahid, Professor at University of California, San Francisco, USA. \t\n",
    " Development of new TB treatments is very long and costly, and hampered by several methodological limitations.\t\n",
    "The most commonly touted challenge in TB therapeutics remains the absence of a surrogate marker that can be readily measured and that estimates with adequate certainty the anticipated treatment effect in late stage clinical development.\t\n",
    "New opportunities are emerging with the recent developments in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics methodologies, novel clinical trial designs, new biomarkers, as well as recent advances in molecular diagnostics.\t\n",
    "A recently broadened and exciting pipeline of new candidate drugs compels us to revisit our current approaches to TB drug development, and based on the learnings of the last 50 years, to identify and seek consensus on best practices for future TB clinical trial designs.\t\n",
    "GENEVA and Washington, D.C. ƒ?? A new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Solidarity Response Fund will raise money from a wide range of donors to support the work of the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners to help countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. \t\n",
    "The fund, the first-of-its-kind, enables private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO.\t\n",
    "ƒ??We are at a critical point in the global response to COVID-19 ƒ?? we need everyone to get involved in this massive effort to keep the world safe,ƒ?� said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ƒ??We are immensely grateful to the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for coming forward to help us set up this fund. \t\n",
    "A lot of people and institutions have been saying they want to contribute to the fight against the novel coronavirus. Now they can.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "In a coordinated effort to combat the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have agreed to work closely to ensure the latest and most reliable information and tailored guidance reaches the global business community. \t\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health and societal emergency that requires effective immediate action by governments, individuals and businesses. \t\n",
    "All businesses have a key role to play in minimising the likelihood of transmission and impact on society.\t\n",
    "Early, bold and effective action will reduce short- term risks to employees and long-term costs to businesses and the  economy.\t\n",
    "During its 63rd session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) accepted all recommendations from the 42nd meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD). \t\n",
    "This effectively brings twelve psychoactive substances, including eleven New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and one medicine, under international control.  \t\n",
    "Given the potential for dependence or abuse and known adverse effects, these compounds pose a risk to public health and society and are largely without any therapeutic benefit. \t\n",
    "Based on an in-depth review of candidate compounds by the ECDD, an independent group of experts in the field of drugs and medicines, the WHO provides annual recommendations on substance scheduling to the CND, a policy-making body comprised of 53 UN Member States.\t\n",
    "This ECDD review includes a balanced consideration of potential for abuse, dependence and harm with therapeutic value. \t\n",
    "The CND then votes on whether or not the WHO recommendations for placing reviewed substances under international control should be endorsed.\t\n",
    "A total of 54 human cases of dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019, with Chad reporting 48 out of the 54 cases\t\n",
    "In Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan, trained volunteers are supporting surveillance and detection of infections in domestic dogs and cats. Surveillance has been heightened, as evidenced by the increase in reports of rumoured human cases which in 2019 peaked at 108 207 out of which 106 678 were investigated within 24 hours.\t\n",
    "ƒ??We are working with the broader scientific community to understand the epidemiology of animal infections, mainly in dogs in Chad, where the highest number of human cases were reported in 2019,ƒ?� said Dr Dieudonn?? Sankara, who leads WHOƒ??s eradication and elimination team in the Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases.\t\n",
    "Interestingly, there have been no human cases in Ethiopia and Mali, and 4 human cases in South Sudan in 2019, compared with 10 in 2018.\t\n",
    "Geneva, 23 March 2020: FIFA, the international governing body of football, and the World Health Organization (WHO) have teamed up to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) by launching a new awareness campaign led by world-renowned footballers, who are calling on all people around the world to follow five key steps to stop the spread of the disease.\t\n",
    "ƒ??Pass the message to kick out coronavirusƒ?� campaign promotes five key steps for people to follow to protect their health in line with WHO guidance, focused on hand washing, coughing etiquette, not touching your face, physical distance and staying home if feeling unwell.  \t\n",
    "ƒ??FIFA and its President Gianni Infantino have been actively involved in passing the message against this pandemic since the very beginning,ƒ?� said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the virtual launch of the campaign at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. \t\n",
    "ƒ??Be it through campaigns or funding, FIFA has stood up to the coronavirus, and I am delighted that world football is supporting WHO to kick out the coronavirus. I have no doubt with this type of support that together we will win.ƒ?� \t\n",
    "GENEVA  As the world comes together to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to ensure that essential health services and operations are continued to protect the lives of people with TB and other diseases or health conditions. \t\n",
    "Health services, including national programmes to combat TB, need to be actively engaged in ensuring an effective and rapid response to COVID-19 while ensuring that TB services are maintained.\t\n",
    "In the lead- up to World TB Day, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General emphasized in a news release, ƒ??COVID-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be. \t\n",
    "The world committed to end TB by 2030; improving prevention is key to making this happen.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "At this unique time in history when the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes stands in solidarity with governments and communities as they seek to maintain health services and continue to address the needs of patients suffering from HIV and tuberculosis (TB). \t\n",
    "Despite being preventable and treatable, tuberculosis remains the worldƒ??s biggest infectious killer and the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV), responsible for 32% of the 770 000 lives lost to HIV in 2018. \t\n",
    "People living with HIV are far more vulnerable (nearly 20 times more) to TB infection than people without HIV and are three times more likely to die during TB treatment.\t\n",
    "While there are proven interventions that reduce TB deaths ƒ?? such as provision of TB preventive treatment, adoption of novel diagnostics for earlier TB diagnosis and linkage to treatment, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) ƒ?? we are far behind in scaling these up, and diagnostic and treatment gaps remain, with only half of estimated TB cases among PLHIV reaching care in 2018, only half of estimated PLHIV with TB receiving ART, and less than half of PLHIV new on ART initiating TB preventive treatment in a subset of countries which reported globally.\t\n",
    "Substantial progress has been made during the past decade to prevent and control schistosomiasis (also known as bilharziasis) globally\t\n",
    "The disease affects more than 230 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.\t\n",
    "Progress is mainly due to large-scale periodic treatment of affected populations with praziquantel, the only medicine recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) against all forms of schistosomiasis\t\n",
    "Regular treatment cures mild symptoms and prevents progression to severe, chronic disease. \t\n",
    ". ƒ??Through progressive scale-up of periodic large-scale treatment to control morbidity in many endemic countries, we are closer to achieving the minimum target of 75% global coverage of all schoolƒ?�aged children,ƒ?� said Dr Amadou Garba Djirmay, who leads WHOƒ??s global schistosomiasis control programme. \t\n",
    "ƒ??But if we want to achieve elimination, we must go a step further to introduce snail control in hot spots and in areas targeting elimination. This is bound to increase impact and accelerate progress towards interruption of transmission.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "GENEVA - Prevention and treatment services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have been severely disrupted since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to a WHO survey released today.\t\n",
    "The survey, which was completed by 155 countries during a 3-week period in May, confirmed that the impact is global, but that low-income countries are most affected.\t\n",
    "This situation is of significant concern because people living with NCDs are at higher risk of severe COVID-19-related illness and death.\t\n",
    "ƒ??The results of this survey confirm what we have been hearing from countries for a number of weeks now,ƒ?� said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.\t\n",
    "ƒ??Many people who need treatment for diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes have not been receiving the health services and medicines they need since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\t\n",
    "Itƒ??s vital that countries find innovative ways to ensure that essential services for NCDs continue, even as they fight COVID-19.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "New guidance from the World Health Organization will help countries keep essential health services running whilst taking measures to keep people safe in the COVID-19 pandemic.\t\n",
    "Most health systems are facing challenges of increased demand for care of people with COVID-19, compounded by fear, misinformation and limitations on movement that disrupt the delivery of health care for all conditions.\t\n",
    "Countries must find ways to keep people safe and ensure the delivery of services such as emergency care for conditions like heart attacks and injury; immunization to prevent outbreaks; treatment for infectious diseases like HIV, malaria and tuberculosis; and screening and treatment for noncommunicable diseases like cancer and diabetes.\t\n",
    "With COVID-19 science now doubling every 20 days and new guidance being published daily by WHO, health workers face the challenge of keeping up with constantly evolving information related to this disease.\t\n",
    "To support them, the WHO Academy has created an app that delivers a wide range of COVID-19 knowledge resources developed by WHO directly to their mobile phones and tablets.\t\n",
    "The app includes up-to-the-minute guidance, tools, training, and virtual workshops to support health workers in caring for patients with COVID-19 and in protecting themselves as they do their critical work.\t\n",
    "User-friendly and easily accessed in almost any area with mobile phone service, the free app is available in seven languages ƒ?? Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.\t\n",

    ".ƒ??WHOƒ??s upcoming road map for neglected tropical diseases for 2021ƒ??2030 proposes a new model of operation,ƒ?� said Dr Mwelecele Malecela, Director, WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases.\t\n",
    "ƒ??This road map, with its major shifts, is even more relevant in the context of COVID-19 as it promotes resilience, health system strengthening, community participation, equity, country ownership and enhanced partner involvement through integrated, multisectoral collaboration.\t\n",
    "ƒ?�During the inaugural webinar on 17 June, two panels will discuss the shifts needed during post-COVID-19 recovery to achieve the road map targets for 2030.\t\n",
    "The first panel will consider how the global community can build on and use innovative approaches to sustain the progress made thus far.\t\n",
    "The second panel will explore how to align and coordinate work with countries and stakeholders, enhance multisectoral coordination to achieve the global targets and examine the role of health workers and volunteers across various interventions.\t\n",
    "WHO is following up with Chinese authorities about a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, Peopleƒ??s Republic of China.\t\n",
    "Today, officials from the National Health Commission and Beijing Health Commission briefed WHOƒ??s China country office, to share details of preliminary investigations ongoing in Beijing.\t\n",
    "As of 13 June, 41 symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases and 46 laboratory confirmed cases without symptoms of COVID-19 have been identified in Beijing.\t\n",
    "The first identified case had symptom onset on 9 June, and was confirmed on 11 June.\t\n",
    "Several of the initial cases were identified through six fever clinics in Beijing.\t\n",
    "Preliminary investigations revealed that some of the initial symptomatic cases had a link to the Xinfadi Market in Beijing.\t\n",
    "Preliminary laboratory investigations of throat swabs from humans and environmental samples from Xinfadi Market identified 45 positive human samples (all without symptoms at the time of reporting) and 40 positive environmental samples.\t\n",
    "One additional case without symptoms was identified as a close contact of a confirmed case.\t\n",
    "All cases are in isolation and under care as needed, and contact tracing is underway.\t\n",
    "Genetic sequencing of samples is also underway and rapid sharing of these results is important to understand the origin of the cluster and links between cases.\t\n",
    "WHO has offered support and technical assistance, as well as requested further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned.\t\n",
    "On Olympic Day, 23 June 2020, the International Olympic Committee and WHO together with the United Nations launch a partnership to encourage individuals and communities around the world to be #HEALTHYTogether.\t\n",
    "The three partners and Olympic athletes will spotlight the global collaboration needed to stay healthy and reduce the spread and impact of COVID-19.\t\n",
    "Olympic athletes will help deliver important public health information, to inspire people to adopt or continue behaviours that will curtail the pandemic and provide information that promotes physical and mental health.\t\n",
    "The partnership kicks off today with Olympians around the world showcasing various exercises to stay healthy during this time.\t\n",
    "A WHO survey showed that many people who had severe COVID-19 disease were already living with or at risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).\t\n",
    "The results emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle including being physically active, having a healthy diet, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol.\t\n",
    "On June 25, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Dr Hand Kluge, Regional Director of WHO Europe, spoke at the European Parliament Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) on the fight against COVID-19 and the global response and highlighted the leadership of the European Union during this unprecedented time.\t\n",
    "ƒ??The EU is in a unique position to provide global leadership in defining the ƒ??new normalƒ?� as part of the global recoveryƒ?�, Dr Tedros said.\t\n",
    "He reminded parlamentarians, that ƒ??although the situation in Europe has improved, globally it is still getting worseƒ?� and he added that ƒ??In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported to WHO.\t\n",
    "In the last month, almost 4 million cases have been reported.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "The pandemic is showing how essential it is for governments at all levels, including local governments, to strengthen their capacity for prevention, preparedness and response.\t\n",
    "But plans for the post-COVID-19 recovery, and to reduce the risk of future epidemics, must go further upstream than early detection and control of disease outbreaks ƒ?? ƒ??they must also lessen our impact on the environment, to reduce risk at the sourceƒ?�, Dr Tedros stressed.\t\n",
    "WHO today accepted the recommendation from the Solidarity Trialƒ??s International Steering Committee to discontinue the trialƒ??s hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir arms.\t\n",
    "The Solidarity Trial was established by WHO to find an effective COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients.\t\n",
    "The International Steering Committee formulated the recommendation in light of the evidence for hydroxychloroquine vs standard-of-care and for lopinavir/ritonavir vs standard-of-care from the Solidarity trial interim results, and from a review of the evidence from all trials\t\n",
    "These interim trial results show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir produce little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care.\t\n",
    "Solidarity trial investigators will interrupt the trials with immediate effect.\t\n",
    "For each of the drugs, the interim results do not provide solid evidence of increased mortality.\t\n",
    "There were, however, some associated safety signals in the clinical laboratory findings of the add-on Discovery trial, a participant in the Solidarity trial.\t\n",
    "These will also be reported in the peer-reviewed publication.\t\n",
    "This decision applies only to the conduct of the Solidarity trial in hospitalized patients and does not affect the possible evaluation in other studies of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir in non-hospitalized patients or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19.\t\n",
    "The interim Solidarity results are now being readied for peer-reviewed publication.\t\n",

    "The World Health Organization and UNICEF warned today of an alarming decline in the number of children receiving life-saving vaccines around the world.\t\n",
    "This is due to disruptions in the delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\t\n",
    "According to new data by WHO and UNICEF, these disruptions threaten to reverse hard-won progress to reach more children and adolescents with a wider range of vaccines, which has already been hampered by a decade of stalling coverage.\t\n",
    "The latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from WHO and UNICEF for 2019 shows that improvements such as the expansion of the HPV vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing.\t\n",
    "For example, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 points to a substantial drop in the number of children completing three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3).\t\n",
    "This is the first time in 28 years that the world could see a reduction in DTP3 coverage ƒ?? the marker for immunization coverage within and across countries.\t\n",
    "Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.\t\n",
    "The 75 countries, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, partner with up to 90 lower-income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to Gaviƒ??s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).\t\n",
    "). Together, this group of up to 165 countries represents more than 60% of the worldƒ??s population. Among the group are representatives from every continent and more than half of the worldƒ??s G20 economies.\t\n",
    "ƒ??COVAX is the only truly global solution to the COVID-19 pandemic,ƒ?� said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\t\n",
    "For the vast majority of countries, whether they can afford to pay for their require assistance, it means receiving a guaranteed share of avoiding being pushed to the back of the queue\t\n",
    "Even for those countries that are able to secure their own agreements with vaccine manufacturers, this mechanism represents, through its world-leading portfolio of vaccine candidates, a means of reducing the risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure.\t\n",
    "World Health Organization Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today joined the leadership of Spain, paying homage to those who have lost their lives in the country due to COVID-19, saluting the heroic efforts of heath workers and praising the governmentƒ??s resolute and robust response to reverse the virusƒ??s transmission.\t\n",

    "ƒ??I extend my deepest condolences to the families of all people who have lost their lives due to this virus in Spain, and around the world.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "At one point, Spain was among the countries impacted most by COVID-19. At the outbreakƒ??s peak, close to 10 000 new cases were reported in a single day in Spain.\t\n",
    "Since then, intensive efforts, led by robust surveillance, testing, contact tracing, treatment and isolation, have managed to suppress transmission.\t\n",
    "Dr Tedros said this shift was due to the leadership shown by Spain and the strong resolve shown by the Spanish public to adhere to strict restrictions, including lockdowns, physical distancing and other critical measures to contain transmission.\t\n",
    "These efforts, combined, have successfully changed the course of the countryƒ??s outbreak.\t\n",
    "ƒ??Spain has shown that with political leadership and action, backed by community support, that COVID-19 can be controlled, no matter at what stage virus transmission is at in a country.\t\n",
    "From being greatly challenged, Spain has reversed the trajectory of the outbreak,ƒ?� Dr Tedros added.\t\n",
    "ƒ??While we have witnessed the suppression of the virus across Spain, I support the commitment by Spanish authorities to remain vigilant in the face of the persistent threat that COVID-19 poses.ƒ?�\t\n",

    "In its statement following the meeting, published today, it expressed ƒ??appreciation for WHO and partnersƒ?? COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, and highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this COVID-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "After a full discussion and review of the evidence, the Committee unanimously agreed that the outbreak still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and offered this advice to Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.\t\n",
    "Dr Tedros accepted the advice of the Committee and confirmed that the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to constitute a PHEIC.\t\n",
    "The Director-General declared a PHEICƒ??WHOƒ??s highest level of alarm under IHRƒ??on 30 January at a time when there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside China.\t\n",
    "He issued the Committeeƒ??s advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.\t\n",
    "ƒ??The pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come,\" Dr Tedros told the Committee in his opening remarks on Friday.\t\n",
    "\"Many countries that believed they were past the worst are now grappling with new outbreaks.\t\n",

    "As schools worldwide struggle with reopening, the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) reveal that 43 per cent of schools around the world lacked access to basic handwashing with soap and water in 2019 ƒ?? a key condition for schools to be able to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\t\n",
    "ƒ??Global school closures since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have presented an unprecedented challenge to childrenƒ??s education and wellbeing,ƒ?� said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.\t\n",
    "ƒ??We must prioritize childrenƒ??s learning.\t\n",
    "This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen ƒ?? including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water and safe sanitation.ƒ?�\t\n",
    "According to the report, around 818 million children lack basic handwashing facilities at their schools, which puts them at increased risk of COVID-19 and other transmittable diseases.\t\n",
    "More than one third of these children (295 million) are from sub-Saharan Africa.\t\n",
    "In the least developed countries, 7 out of 10 schools lack basic handwashing facilities and half of schools lack basic sanitation and water services.\t\n",
    "The report stresses that governments seeking to control the spread of COVID-19 must balance the need for implementation of public health measures versus the associated social and economic impacts of lockdown measures.\t\n",
    "Evidence of the negative impacts of prolonged school closures on childrenƒ??s safety, wellbeing and learning are well-documented, the report says.\t\n",
    "The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) call on governments to ensure that the procurement and supply of controlled medicines in countries meet the needs of patients, both those who have COVID-19 and those who require internationally controlled medicines for other medical conditions.\t\n",
    "There is a need to ensure access to controlled medicines such as sedatives and analgesics for intubation protocols for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.\t\n",
    "Non-COVID patients continue to require controlled medicines for the management of pain and palliative care, surgical care and anaesthesia, mental health and neurological conditions, and for the treatment of drug use disorders.\t\n",
    "It is important to remember the needs of existing patients who require controlled medicines for the management of these health conditions.\t\n",
    "These patients faced barriers to accessing controlled medicines before the COVID-19 pandemic.\t\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has further resulted in interruptions of the medicines supply chain, and it is critical that access to essential health services and medications not be forgotten or de-prioritised during this pandemic.\t\n",
    "On 14 August Korean Ambassador, Ms Ji-ah Paik and WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with WHO in support of the Organizationƒ??s COVID-19 response efforts in the African region.\t\n",
    "The new MoU follows a recent call between Dr Tedros and Mr Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, during which WHO Director-General expressed the need for additional support to scale up the COVID-19 response in the African region.\t\n",
    "The MoU sets out an in-kind contribution of US$ 6 million in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests / extraction kits to be delivered to 24 countries in Africa in the coming months.\t\n",
    "PCR has proven to be a critically important laboratory tool, providing results that are reliable and consistent.\t\n",
    "ƒ??WHO is deeply grateful for this support, which is helping to increase the testing capacity in Africa,ƒ?� said Dr Tedros.\t\n",
    "ƒ??This tremendous show of support is also strengthening the relationship between WHO and the Republic of Korea.\t\n",

    "It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.\t\n",
    "In order to be able to secure enough doses of vaccines to protect the most vulnerable populations, such as health workers and the elderly, the next step for the partnership is to confirm potential self-financing participantsƒ?? intent to participate by 31 August and to turn these into binding commitments to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) by 18 September, with first upfront payments to follow thereafter, and no later than 9 October 2020.\t\n",
    "ƒ??Equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus and paving the way for recovery from the pandemic,ƒ?� said Stefan L??fven, Prime Minister of Sweden.\t\n",

    "Mental health is one of the most neglected areas of public health.\t\n",
    "Close to 1 billion people are living with a mental disorder, 3 million people die every year from the harmful use of alcohol and one person dies every 40 seconds by suicide.\t\n",
    "And now, billions of people around the world have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is having a further impact on peopleƒ??s mental health.\t\n",
    "Yet, relatively few people around the world have access to quality services.\t\n",
    "In low- and middle-income countries, more than 75% of people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders receive no treatment for their condition at all. Furthermore, stigma, discrimination, punitive legislation and human rights abuses are still widespread.\t\n",
    "The limited access to quality, affordable mental health care in the world before the pandemic, and particularly in humanitarian emergencies and conflict settings, has been further diminished due to COVID-19 as the pandemic has disrupted health services around the world.\t\n",
    "Primary causes have been infection and the risk of infection in long-stay facilities such as care homes and psychiatric institutions; barriers to meeting people face-to-face.\t\n",
    "The World Health Organization (WHO) today published a first indicative survey on the impact of COVID-19 on health systems based on 105 countriesƒ?? reports.\t\n",
    "Data collected from five regions over the period from March to June 2020 illustrate that almost every country (90%) experienced disruption to its health services, with low- and middle-income countries reporting the greatest difficulties.\t\n",
    "Most countries reported that many routine and elective services have been suspended, while critical care - such as cancer screening and treatment and HIV therapy ƒ?? has seen high-risk interruptions in low-income countries.\t\n",
    "The survey shines a light on the cracks in our health systems, but it also serves to inform new strategies to improve healthcare provision during the pandemic and beyond,ƒ?� said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.\t\n",

    "Countries also reported disruptions in malaria diagnosis and treatment (46%), tuberculosis case detection and treatment (42%) and antiretroviral treatment (32%).\t\n",
    "While some areas of health care, such as dental care and rehabilitation, may have been deliberately suspended in line with government protocols, the disruption of many of the other services is expected to have harmful effects on population health in the short- medium- and long-term.\t\n",
    "Potentially life-saving emergency services were disrupted in almost a quarter of responding countries.\t\n",
